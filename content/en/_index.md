title: "Welcome to The libptpmgmt Project"
---

The libptpmgmt Project provides a library to communicate with [LinuxPTP](https://linuxptp.nwtime.org) using IEEE 1558 management messages over a network. It supports `get`, `set`, and `command` of all management TLVs that are described in [IEEE 1588-2019](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1588/6825/). In addition, the library supports LinuxPTP specific implementation management TLVs.

The library is written in C++ using a data-oriented model and supports native scripting using SWIG wrappers for Python, ruby, Lua, Perl, PHP, and TCL. libptpmgmt is published under the LGPL 3.0 license.
