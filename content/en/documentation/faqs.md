# FAQs

***Q:***  
I downloaded the libptpmgmt from [sourceforge](https://sf.net/p/libptpmgmt/) and then tried to use the libptpmgmt with python test. But getting following error.  

    # python3 test.py
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "test.py", line 14, in <module>
        import ptpmgmt
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ptpmgmt'

***A:***  
The test script fails to find the libraries.  
Python script needs 2 libraries:  
 1. `libptpmgmt.so` - The ptpmgmt C++ library.  
 2. `ptpmgmt.py` and `_ptpmgmt.so` - The python wrapper library.

You can install the libraries in your system.  
Or you can use:  
 1. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to tell the shell the path to `libptpmgmt.so`.  
 2. `PYTHONPATH` to tell the shell the location of the python wrapper library files.

For example:  
`$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.. PYTHONPATH=3 python3 test.py`

***Q:***  
Can you provide details how can I make use of ptpmgmt to get, query and set PTP configuration parameters?

***A:***  
The PTP daemon comes with its own configuration.  The ptpmgmt uses the PTP IEEE management messages to monitor, query and set.

Look in the `test.py`, it shows reading and setting of `PRIORITY1`.  You could also see `sample/sync_watch.py` which "continuously checks whether a PTP client is well synced to its master", using the `PORT_DATA_SET`, `PARENT_DATA_SET`, `CURRENT_DATA_SET`.

The library supports [linuxptp](https://linuxptp.nwtime.org/) vendor specific TLVs like: `SUBSCRIBE_EVENTS_NP`.

***Q:***  
Where are `ptpmgmt.py` and `_ptpmgmt.so` files? How do I build them?

***A:***  

They are built by the project.

You need [swig](https://swig.org/) to generate the wrapper code, and [python](https://www.python.org) development package for [C API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html).

The `make` file would skip the python wrapper library if python development were absent.

The project supports several languages in addition to native C++ library.  The `make` does **NOT** notify the absence of languages, as the user may defer them.

***Q:***  
Where can I download the `ptpmgmt.py` and `_ptpmgmt.so` files?

***A:***  

The project does not provide binaries.  You can build packages for your Linux distribution.  
 1. [Debian package](https://wiki.debian.org/deb)  
 2. [RPM package](https://rpm.org/)  
 3. [Arch Linux package](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/creating_packages)  

Users can create packages for their system.  The packages are per language, so for example, you can install the package for python only.

***Q:***  
I use Cent OS Linux.

***A:***  

You can build RPMs with  
`$ make rpm`

The RPMs are tested on Fedora and should work on all [RPM-based Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RPM-based).

The RPM files are stored under the `rpm/RPMS/` folder.
